This repo showcases our experiments and modifications based on the DeepCut algorithm.

We took the original codebase and ran additional experiments.

## üß™ Our Approach

We explored whether the **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** in DeepCut, trained with the **Normalized Cut (N-cut)** loss, could still learn meaningful image segmentations **without relying on transformer-based features**.

To do this:

- We removed the Vision Transformer (ViT) feature extractor used in the original DeepCut.
- Instead, we applied the **SLIC superpixel algorithm** to obtain image patches.
- These superpixels were used to construct a graph directly from the image.
- The GNN was then trained on this graph using the same N-cut loss as in the original method.

Our goal was to assess the standalone learning capacity of the GNN for unsupervised segmentation when given a purely spatial, low-level representation.
